#About the project
 Code in python to find the max matching in a Bipartite Graph

#How to use
First, make sure you have python installed in your system and IDE.
In the main.py execution, you will need the "instance.txt", you can make this file manually or you can execute the instance_generator to make this file.
The instance generator needs 3 parameters: 1ยบ number of candidates, 2ยบ number of vacancies and 3ยบ Density of Graph. It will build a "instance.txt" with the random edges based in the parameters. 
These edges represent the edges of the graph on which we will use in the main.py execution.
With the "instance.txt" rigth you can run the main.py in terminal using "python main.py".
The response will be the "results.txt" with the results of max matching.
